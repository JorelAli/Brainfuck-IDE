<p>The IDE is made up of four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workspace (top left)</li>
<li>Controls (top right)</li>
<li>Output (bottom left)</li>
<li>Memory output (bottom right)</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Workspace_8"></a>Workspace</h4>
<p>The workspace is the area where your Brainfuck code is written. The IDE will allow comments (Anything non-brainfuck) for simplicity of reading, however these comments may be destroyed when formatted by the IDE.</p>
<h4><a id="Controls_11"></a>Controls</h4>
<p>The controls have a range of functions to allow you to test your code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run - Runs the code</li>
<li>Stop - Stops the code. Useful if the code awaits for an input but needs stopping</li>
<li>Reset - Resets the outputs. Output and Memory output is cleared.</li>
<li>Format - Formats Brainfuck code into a more human-readable format</li>
<li>Unformat - Formats Brainfuck code into a single line</li>
<li>Wrapping mode - Enables or disables Brainfuck wrapping, which allows/disallows using '-' to go to the max cell value</li>
<li>Set memory (Cells) - Sets the number of cells to be used for the program. If no cells are defined, it will use 384 by default</li>
<li>Input - When executing code, any inputted characters can be entered here</li>
<li>Cell size (Bits) - Sets the number of bits per cell. 8 bits is between 0 and 256, 16 bits is between 0 and 65536 and so on</li>
<li>Enter a character - This box allows you to enter any character and it will output the ASCII code for that character</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Output_24"></a>Output</h4>
<p>The output is where the code's output is printed.</p>
<h4><a id="Memory_output_27"></a>Memory output</h4>
<p>The memory output displays the cells, along with the values in each cell. After the program has been run, the cell highlighted will be where the pointer lies.</p>
